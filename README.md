\# Unified Angular Mathematics (UAM) Repository



This project explores Unified Angular Mathematics (UAM)—a framework integrating angular bifurcation, interference geometry, and π³ cosmological constants to investigate the origins and structure of the universe.



\## Objectives

\- Formalize the relationship between π³ and cosmological density ratios

\- Model CMB power spectra and BAO clustering using Python

\- Develop falsifiable predictions for new physics via UAM



\## Structure

\- `paper/`: Manuscript drafts, diagrams (e.g., logical chord inside sphere wedge)

\- `code/`: Python simulations and tools

\- `data/`: Observational datasets for validation

\- `notes/`: Raw ideas, theoretical insights, derivations



\## Status

Early phase—repo initialized. Core content forthcoming.
