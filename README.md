\# Unified Angular Mathematics (UAM)



Welcome to the Unified Angular Mathematics (UAM) Projectâ€”a research framework exploring the deep connections between angular bifurcation, interference geometry, and cosmological constants. This repository hosts active research into Ï€Â³ relationships, cosmic energy partitioning, and the mathematical underpinnings of the early universe.



## ðŸ§  Overview



UAM posits that angular phenomenaâ€”particularly bifurcation and interferenceâ€”underlie fundamental energy dynamics at cosmological scales. Through analytical geometry, symbolic logic, and physical modeling, this framework aims to:



\- Investigate how Ï€Â³ maps onto matter-energy density ratios

\- Model the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)

\- Explore the role of angular bifurcation during the Big Bang's energy dispersion

\- Define falsifiable predictions to extend the Standard Model



## ðŸ“‚ Repository Layout



\- `paper/` â€” Drafts, LaTeX manuscripts, diagrams (e.g. sphere wedges, logical chords)

\- `code/` â€” Python simulations for CMB/BAO modeling and angular partition tests

\- `data/` â€” Observational datasets for theoretical validation

\- `notes/` â€” Raw insights, derivations, and conceptual threads



## ðŸš§ Status



Repository initialized. Core content is under active development. Initial diagrams and simulation code forthcoming.
